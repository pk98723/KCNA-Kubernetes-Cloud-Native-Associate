Containers
- What is a container

Most important example of container is DOCKER

- Lets say we have a webserver(Node express), Database(Mongo DB), Messaging service and Orchestration(Ansible) have to host on a VM to serve the requirement.
- At times there will be compatibility issues among these services with underlying hardware infra or OS or Libraries of the application.

How to solve
- With Docker we can run the apps severatly with their own Library and Depenendents.
- So containers are completly isolated environments as in they can have their own processes, networks, mounts etc., which will be compatible with underlying OS and hardware.
- Docker ulizes LXC type containers.

Operating System
- Lets say we have differnt OS like Fedora, SUSE, Ubuntu or CentOS all consist of 2 things a set of softwares and OS Kernel.
- The OS kernel is responsible for interacting with underlying Hardware while the OS kernel remains the same like Linux the softwares above it will make the OS different.
